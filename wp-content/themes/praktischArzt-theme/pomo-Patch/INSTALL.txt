Native gettext-patch for Wordpress 3.3
--------------------------------------
For WordPress 3.3 we did a complete rewrite of the patch to make wordpress
work with PHP's native gettext-support.

The Patch now emulates the PoMo-API and creates an alias from the old class
named "MO" to itself - you just have to make sure that its loaded *before*
pomo is loaded.

File that were modified:
  wp-settings.php

Files that were added
  wp-includes/pomo/native.php


Installation using the patch-file
---------------------------------
If you are a professional and choose not to trust us (which is welcome,
anyway!) you may use the supplied native_gettext.patch-file to review our
changes and patch your wordpress 3.3 installation.

Just change to your WP-Installation-Directory and apply the patch:

  cd ~/wordpress
  patch -p1 < /path/to/native_gettext.patch


Installation using patched files
--------------------------------
If you are not able to patch your wordpress-installation, you may use the
supplied .php-files. The previous versions of our patch shipped within a
single l10n.php, the new version needs two files - one to be changed, one to
be added.

1. Make a backup of your wp-settings.php
2. Replace the wp-settings.php with the one supplied by us
3. Copy the native.php to wp-includes/pomo/
4. Enjoy and spread the word!
